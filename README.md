   - Manage flight details such as departure and arrival times, destinations, and aircraft information.
   - Monitor and update flight statuses in real-time.

2. **Reservation System:**
   - Enable passengers to search for and book flights.
   - Handle booking cancellations and modifications.
   - Generate and manage booking records, including seat assignments and payment information.

3. **Passenger Management:**
   - Register and maintain passenger profiles.
   - Track passenger travel history and preferences.
   - Provide features for updating personal details and managing loyalty programs.

4. **Staff Management:**
   - Administer staff profiles, roles, and permissions.
   - Manage staff schedules and assignments.
   - Facilitate staff access to necessary functionalities based on their roles.

5. **Ticketing System:**
   - Issue electronic tickets and provide ticketing information.
   - Process ticket payments and generate receipts.
   - Handle refunds and adjustments as needed.

6. **Reporting and Analytics:**
   - Generate reports on flight operations, reservations, and passenger statistics.
